ChatGlobal
==========

Break the language barrier. Chat around the world.

ChatGlobal is a chat service that randomly connects you to another user, who might be next door or across the world. Chat is automatically translated into each user's native language, so you never have to worry about the language barrier.

ChatGlobal makes use of several existing packages:
* [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) is for the matching and translation server.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is used to simplify the frontend code.
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is used for the frontend styling framework.
